# Feature Specification: DNS Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-phase-1-dns`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "001-phase-1-dns"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: What specific DNS operations should this feature support? → A: Basic DNS record management with Route53 integration for domain discovery and subdomain creation

### Session 2025-09-29 (Additional)

- Q: What are the performance and scalability requirements for DNS operations? → A: Basic setup: <100 domains, <1000 DNS records total, operations complete within 30 seconds
- Q: What are the security and privacy requirements for DNS operations? → A: Minimal security: Basic validation only, focus on functionality over security (MVP approach)
- Q: What level of AWS Route53 error handling and recovery is needed? → A: Basic error handling: Show user-friendly messages for API failures, manual retry

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a service operator, I want to add my domain to Cloud Router so that I can easily create subdomains for my services and see all existing DNS records, allowing me to manage my domain's DNS configuration alongside my routing setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a domain that exists in Route53, **When** I add it to Cloud Router, **Then** the system finds the matching hosted zone and displays all current DNS records
2. **Given** a domain that doesn't exist in Route53, **When** I add it to Cloud Router, **Then** the system creates a new hosted zone and displays the nameserver records I need to add at my domain registrar
3. **Given** a domain added to Cloud Router, **When** I create a route with a dedicated subdomain, **Then** a new DNS record is automatically created in Route53 pointing to the Cloud Router
4. **Given** a domain in Cloud Router with existing DNS records, **When** I view the domain page, **Then** I can see all current records including type, name, value, and TTL

### Edge Cases

- How does the system handle domains with many DNS records (performance/scalability)?
- What happens when multiple hosted zones match a domain name?
- How are DNS record conflicts handled when creating subdomains?
- What happens when domain registrar delegation is not configured correctly?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add domains by name and automatically discover matching Route53 hosted zones, creating a new hosted zone if none exists
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve and display all DNS records from the discovered Route53 hosted zone
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist domain information including name and associated hosted zone ID
- **FR-004**: System MUST create CNAME records in Route53 when routes with dedicated subdomains are created
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate domain ownership before allowing DNS record modifications
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent DNS record conflicts when creating new subdomains
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle Route53 API errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback
- **FR-008**: System MUST display the nameserver records for newly created hosted zones so users can configure domain delegation at their registrar

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: System MUST support up to 100 domains and 1000 total DNS records
- **NFR-002**: Domain addition operations MUST complete within 30 seconds
- **NFR-003**: DNS record retrieval and display MUST complete within 30 seconds
- **NFR-004**: Route53 API operations MUST provide user-friendly error messages for failures with manual retry capability
- **NFR-005**: System MUST implement basic domain ownership validation (MVP security)

### Future Security Enhancements

_Note: Comprehensive security features deferred to future phase per MVP requirements_

**Recommended Security Features:**

- Multi-factor authentication for DNS operations
  - Will require a full user account system to be implemented
- Encryption of sensitive DNS record data at rest
- Comprehensive audit logging with compliance requirements
- Access controls and role-based permissions
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Integration with security monitoring systems

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Domain**: Represents a DNS domain managed by Cloud Router, containing the domain name and associated Route53 hosted zone ID, with relationships to routes and services
- **DNS Record**: Represents individual DNS records retrieved from Route53, containing type (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.), name, value, TTL, and other record attributes
- **Route**: Represents routing configuration that may create subdomains, with flags indicating whether it creates dedicated subdomains versus path-based routing
