# Cloud-Router Constitution Rules

Make sure to read the constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` before making any changes.

If anything violates the constitution, either by user request or by the agent, you **MUST** either stop and explain the violation, or update the constitution file to reflect the changes.

Any new high level technical decisions that impact the entire project should be documented in the constitution.
